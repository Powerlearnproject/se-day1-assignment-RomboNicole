Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Softwaqre engineering is the process of designing building and maintaining software
Some of its importances are that it gives a platform for development of reliable and safe software solutions that are crucial for businesses to carry out their operations effectively.
It also offers flexibility in that the engineers create systems thet are dynamic and are able to cater for needs of a particular business.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.Emergence of structured programming methodologies.
It enhaced better code readability by coming up with organised appraches to certain concepts.
2.INTRODUUCTION OF OBJECT ORIENTATION PROGRAMMING.
Developers became enabled to create reusable code and also design complex systems in a better way
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.PLANNING.the project scope and objectives are defined
2.ANALYSIS.analaysing and prioritizin requirements to ensure they are aligned with the project goals
3.DESIGN. developing system architecture and creating detailed design documents
4,CODIND.translating design into actual code using the chosen programming language
5.TESTING.carrying out tests to identify and fix any defects
6.DEPLOYMENT.releasing the software to the production environment
MAINTENANCE.updatomg the software after deployment,

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
both share a focus on delivering a quality product that meet customer needs involving planning and development.
both need documentation.
both recognise the importance of involving stakeholders throughout the project lifecycles to gather feedback.
DIFFERENCE
Waterfall allows linear approach with limited flexibility to adapt to changes once a phase is completed while agile encourages iterative development with frequent adjustments based oon feedback.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of carefully crafting prompts to guide an AI model toward generating specific and high quality outputs by giving clear instructions.
It gives controllled outputs where th AI is enabled to give accurate and relevant responses
Maximises efficiency in that the AI model is made to unerstand the task at hand quickly thus giving more efficient responses.
Mitigating bias whereguidlines can minimise the risk of the AI model generating bias responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague promt:Tell me about that war that once happended
clear :please give me details on th second world war and the participating countries.
